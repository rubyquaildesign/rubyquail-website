        <h3>Project Purpose</h3>

        <p>
          Cosm.os was my industrial design honours project.
          it was born out of a mix of my fascination with
          systems thinking, and my difficulty reconciling
          the positive community aspects of social media and
          the negative aspects
        </p>

        <h3>Objective</h3>

        <p>
          Cosm.os aim was to change how we look at social
          media. Through depicting an abstract and
          interactive representation of social network
          systems cosm.os hopes to encourage us to examine
          how we see social media and our interactions with
          it
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>

        <p>
          I developed a few different elements for this
          project this included two interactive objects, a
          digital system simulation, a projection table and
          two plinths to display the objects
        </p>

        <h3>Duration</h3>

        <p>Mar - Oct 2018</p>

        Completed during the first six weeks of the academic
        year, this experiment somewhat of a proof of concept
        of the idea of visually presenting social
        connections. Data was gathered in the form of a very
        light survey which presented participants with
        generated identities with a set of traits and asked
        them the simple question of whether they get along.
        This information was then collated together and
        presented using a “D3.js” based force node graph.

        The first experiment conducted under the umbrella of
        social simulation was the links and nodes
        experiment. This system revolved around the
        measurement of interactions and memory, and how that
        would affect future interactions. Participants could
        create their own identities to insert into the
        system as nodes and apply to them a set of
        behaviours which dictated how they moved about the
        space.

        The second experiment centred around the
        organisation of groups into discrete clusters which
        self-censored communication between its members and
        other clusters. The original premise of this was to
        mimic the communication methodology incorporated by
        the Mastodon social network platform.

        The body and large structure of the exhibit
        consisted of a bamboo structure housing a projector
        mirror assembly that projected the simulation onto
        the acrylic screen above. Two lit bamboo plinths
        designed for the final two interactive objects to
        sit upon sat beside the main piece. The pieces, for
        both designs, were CADed up and CNCed then attached
        to a hand-cut plywood frame that also supported the
        projector and mirror.

        The first object, Vessel, was designed around being
        a point of identity generation, I was inspired by
        themes and stories around alchemy and the creation
        of life. The object empowers the user to pick
        hashtags or traits to apply to their identity and
        then sends it off into the simulation where it
        behaves, and it is treated based on the
        characteristics it is given. The traits were
        designed to be either vague and difficult to make
        sense of, or too general to be useful, this choice
        was an attempt to show how the way computers,
        algorithms and even modern machine learning systems
        make decisions about how social interests on traits
        and behaviours that users may not be aware of or see
        importance in. The object consists of an infinity
        mirror with custom LED boards, an OLED Screen, a set
        of 6 rotary encoders, a thermal printer, and a
        custom controller PCB, designed and made by myself.

        The second object maze came from an anecdote I was
        told to by a friend, they mentioned how navigating
        social situations, both online and offline, can feel
        like navigating a maze. Hearing this I thought about
        flipping that idea on its head and giving users the
        ability to design a maze as an interactive way to
        change the parameters and behaviours of the system.
        Maze consists of a custom LED array, a control
        board, and a set of 10 potentiometers allowing for a
        user to change the controls. Code can be found
