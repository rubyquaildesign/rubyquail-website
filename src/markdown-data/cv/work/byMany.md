I worked at ByMany, mostly on the CultureMoves product. A Tech service designed to improve the culture at organisations through careful, designed nudges. My work on CultureMoves consisted of the design, development, and engineering of the original functional prototype which was used with our testing partners. I also was responsible for building wireframes for CultureMoves minimum viable product and designing and developing digital documents for our clients. Finally, I was actively involved in the wider design and strategy for CultureMoves. As part of this work, I developed JamStack Web applications and APIs. These systems ran on the Azure cloud platform, using CosmosDB, Microsoft Graph, Typescript backend server-less functions. I also developed Front end interfaces using the Svelte component framework to interact with these systems. Finally, I used Figma to develop both high and low fidelity wireframes, and Adobe Indesign and Photoshop to develop digital content for our customers.
