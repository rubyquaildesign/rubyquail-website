Iâ€™m a designer/maker/programmer living in Melbourne. I design and build, systems and tools that support helpers and those they help. The focus of my work is in making services and systems more accessible for people from diverse and marginalised backgrounds, and through inclusive design practices and principles improve services and systems for everyone. I'm passionate about working with complex social and technical systems, and finding ways to simplify them, or new angles to engage and transform them. I'm a generalist who's great at picking up new skills and jumping into new problem spaces. Furthermore, I also have a critical, analytical eye and take nothing for granted when evaluating my work and new avenues of design and technology.
